    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I gave a talk about "Errai - The browser as a platform" at the Java User Group Frankfurt. It was my second time at the JUG and it has been fun again! Most of the audience were surprised that GWT is still alive and very active. Even more they were impressed by the features of Errai and how easy it is to get up and running.</p>

<p>As always everything was well organized and the "Äpplewoi" and the "Schnitzel mit Frankfurter Soß'" was delicious!</p>

<p>Thanks for having me! Here are the slides of my talk: <a href="http://hpehl.info/talks/errai/index.html#/">Errai - The browser as a platform</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I gave a talk about "WildFly 8 - the artist formerly known as JBoss AS" at the Java User Group Frankfurt. The venue was at the 4th floor of the "Deutsche Nationalbibliothek" in Frankfurt. I was quite impressed by the building and the nice meeting room! Afterwards we went to a nearby pub where I enjoyed "Äpplewoi" and a delicious "Schnitzel mit Frankfurter Soß'".</p>

<p>I really enjoyed giving the presentation. Thanks for invitation.</p>

<p>Here are the slides of my talk:</p>
