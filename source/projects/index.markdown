can find most of the projects I'm working on at [GitHub](https://github.com/hpehl). Some of my recent work include 
working on the following projects:

* [WildFly](http://www.wildfly.org/) (fka JBoss AS): Working on management related subjects like the Admin Console.

* Polyglot DMR: [DMR.js](https://github.com/hal/dmr.js), [DMR.dart](https://github.com/hal/dmr.dart), [DMR.scala](https://github.com/hal/dmr.scala)

* [Schlawiner](https://schlawiner-hpehl.rhcloud.com/): Puzzle and dice game based on Errai. Schlawiner is hosted at 
[OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/) and also available in the 
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/schlawiner/kdejnglllpddknpckoffanchkbjhjlkb) and the 
[Firefox Marketplace](https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/schlawiner/).

* [Karaka](http://karaka-d8.appspot.com/): A personal time recording app deployed on Google AppEngine. 

* [Piriti](http://hpehl.info/piriti/): JSON and XML mapper for GWT based on reasonable defaults, a handful of 
annotations and deferred binding.

Besides I like to contribute to open source projects like [GWTP](https://github.com/ArcBees/GWTP). For a more detailed
overview take a look at my [open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/hpehl).
