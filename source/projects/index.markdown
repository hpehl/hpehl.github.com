You can find most of the projects I'm working on at GitHub. Some of my recent work include working on the
following projects:

* JBoss Admin Console

    The admin console for WildFly (fka JBoss AS)

* Schlawiner

    A puzzle and dice game based on Errai. Schlawiner is hosted at OpenShift and also available in the
Chrome Web Store and the Firefox Marketplace.

* Piriti

    Piriti is JSON and XML mapper for GWT based on reasonable defaults, a handful of annotations and deferred binding.
