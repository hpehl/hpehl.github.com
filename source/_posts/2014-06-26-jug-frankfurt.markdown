Yesterday I gave a talk about "WildFly 8 - the artist formerly known as JBoss AS" at the Java User Group Frankfurt. The venue was at the 4th floor of the "Deutsche Nationalbibliothek" in Frankfurt. I was quite impressed by the building and the nice meeting room! Afterwards we went to a nearby pub where I enjoyed "Äpplewoi" and a delicious "Schnitzel mit Frankfurter Soß'".

I really enjoyed giving the presentation. Thanks for invitation.
  
Here are the slides of my talk:
