Yesterday I gave a talk about "Errai - The browser as a platform" at the Java User Group Frankfurt. It was my second time at the JUG and it has been fun again! Most of the audience were surprised that GWT is still alive and very active. Even more they were impressed by the features of Errai and how easy it is to get up and running.

As always everything was well organized and the "Äpplewoi" and the "Schnitzel mit Frankfurter Soß'" was delicious!

Thanks for having me! Here are the slides of my talk: [Errai - The browser as a platform](http://hpehl.info/talks/errai/index.html#/)
