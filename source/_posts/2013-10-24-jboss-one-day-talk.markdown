Yesterday I presented "WildFly 8 - the artist formerly known as JBoss AS" at the
[JBoss One Day Talk](http://onedaytalk.org/) in Munich. Furthermore I had the chance to give a brief introduction to
"DMR.scala / DMR.repl".

I really enjoyed attending the conference. It was well organized and packed with great talks. Feel free to take a lok
at the slides of my talks (partly in German):

- [WildFly 8 - the artist formerly known as JBoss AS](downloads/onedaytalk_wildfly8.pdf)
- [DMR.scala / DMR.repl](http://slid.es/hpehl/dmrscala)
