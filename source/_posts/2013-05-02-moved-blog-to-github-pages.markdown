For over three years I was hosting my blog at Blogger.com. Although publishing was quite easy I never was really happy 
with the layout and the support for customization.<!--more --> 

I was looking for a new provider to host my blog. In particular I wanted to 
 
* write my posts using [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
* be able to have regular pages (like projects, about me, ...)
* have full control over the look and feel of my blog
* assign the blog to a custom domain name

After some research I stumbled across [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) in combination 
with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). The setup is really easy and there are
plenty of resources and documentation around Jekyll and Octopress. 
   
As my blog contains a manageable number of posts, I decided to manually migrate them to markdown. But there is also 
support for [automatic migration](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/blog-migrations#blogger-blogspot). I didn't 
migrate the comments of my blog and started from scratch using [Disqus](http://disqus.com/).

I invested quite some time on the look and feel for my new blog. To a great extent I was inspired by 
the [darkstripes](https://github.com/amelandri/darkstripes) Octopress theme and the blog 
of [Alessandro Melandri](http://melandri.net/). Also my navigation was influenced by the website 
of [Thibault Jorge](http://www.thibaultjorge.com/en). 

The result of the migration is what you're looking at. I hope you like it!
