I'm pleased to announce Piriti 0.3.5. This is a minor update which fixes some bugs and changes the way JSON data is 
parsed. Please take a look at the [release notes](https://github.com/hpehl/piriti/wiki/Releasenotes) for further 
info.<!-- more -->

I'm still looking for a clever way to include namespace support into Piriti. So if there's anybody out there with a 
namespace aware XPath implementation that works in IE, contact me!
