[Taoki](https://github.com/hpehl/taoki) and [Karaka](https://github.com/hpehl/karaka) are mentioned in the free online 
book on GWT and AppEngine development by Marius Andreiana.

The book covers also a lot of [GWTP](https://github.com/ArcBees/GWTP) and its core examples are great illustrations 
for many features of the framework! It also makes use of Gin, Guice, Twig-Persist, Mockito and many other useful tools.

Go check it out: <http://code.google.com/p/gwt-gae-book/>

Many thanks to Marius for such a valuable resource, and congratulations on publishing it!
