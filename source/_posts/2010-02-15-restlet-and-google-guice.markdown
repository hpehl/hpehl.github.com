In an earlier [post](/google-appengine-restlet-guice.html) I described how to configure resources with Google Guice. 
I decided to move the relevant code to a small library called "Taoki" (Maori for "rest").

Besides the features described in the initial post, I added the possibility to configure security for resources. 
The details will be described in a separated post.

For those interested, take a look at <https://github.com/hpehl/taoki>
